Goal: Allow viewing of previous turns.
Needs:
    - Old unit locations
    - Old orders, success/fail, fail reasons, retreats, disbands, builds...
    - Old territory ownership
    - Old country SC counts

Solution:
    - Use Order table for order info AND unit info for Spring/Fall + Winter Builds/disbands
    - Make a UnitLocationSnapshot table for non-newly built / non-disbanded units in Winter;
        - unit_id PK
        - territory_id PK
        - coast_id PK OPT
        - turn INT
        - game_id PK OPT
        - sandbox_id PK OPT
    - Make a TerritoryOwnershipSnapshot table;
        - territory_id PK
        - country_id PK OPT
        - turn INT
        - game_id PK OPT
        - sandbox_id PK OPT
    - Make a CountrySupplyCenterCountSnapshot table;
        - country_id PK
        - sc_count INT
        - game_id PK OPT
        - sandbox_id PK OPT
        - turn INT
Questions...
How often to make new entries to the Territory & Country tables?
    - territory ownership (and thus SC count) updates upon the end of Fall turns.
        - Thus, make new entries at the end of Spring 1901 (first turn) and then at the end of every Fall turn.
        - when accessing a past turn, 
        if Fall turn, use the same turn's tables, 
        if Spring, use the same turn -2's tables, 
        if Winter, use the same turn -1's tables.
How often to make new entries to the Unit table?
    - At the end of Winter turns, with the caveat:
        don't make entries for newly built / newly disbanded units; those will be covered by the Order table.
        - Or, make entries for every single unit...?
