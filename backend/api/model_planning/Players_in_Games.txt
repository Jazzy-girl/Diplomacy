Solution:
    - PlayersGames many-many relational table.
        - player FK
        - game FK
    - Country table: add a player FK field
    - Games table updates:
        - full BOOL (default False, True when has X amount of players)
        - date created i guess
    - POST: Join Game
        - If game isn't full && (game is public || game is private and you have the code)
        - if public, randomly assigned a country that still has no user
