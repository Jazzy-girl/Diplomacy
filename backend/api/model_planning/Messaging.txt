Goal: Players sending email-like messages in-game
Features:
    - Ability to make a new 'thread' / email chain
    - Ability to respond to a current chain
    - Make header title for a chain
    - Choose who is included in a new chain
    - Group chains
    - Get a notification when you receive a message
    - Make multiple exclusive chains with the same header

Solution:
    - Chain table
        - game FK
        - title VARCHAR
    - Message table
        - chain FK
        - country_sender FK
        - text VARCHAR
        - date_created (?) ; used for ordering of messages
    - CountryChain table
        - country FK
        - chain FK
        - unread BOOL ; for notification purposes

Implementation:
    - Player in a game makes a chain as a Country, addressed to # other countries;
        all are put into the CountryChain table and a message is sent.
        All countries except the sneder are notified of a new message and their 'unread' is set to TRUE
