Goal: Players can make, join, play Games.
Features:
    - Create new games
    - View open games
    - Join open games
    - Also: settings...
    - Players can only give orders once games are started
    - Game adjudication on real-time

Solution:
    - PlayersGames many-many relational table.
        - player FK
        - game FK
    - Country table: add a player FK field
    - Games table updates:
        - full BOOL (default False, True when has X amount of players)
        - date created i guess
        - JSONfield for settings, starting with:
            {
                "public": BOOL,
                "press": ENUM ("default", "always", "gunboat"),
                "adjudication": {
                    "type": ENUM ("minutes", "hours", "days")
                    "spring_fall": int (hours),
                    "winter_retreat": int (percent)
                }
            }
    - POST: Join Game
        - If game isn't full && (game is public || game is private and you have the code)
        - if public, randomly assigned a country that still has no user
